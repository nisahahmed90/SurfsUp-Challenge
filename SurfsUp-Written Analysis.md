# SurfsUp-Challenge
## Overview 
The analysis is directed towards temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results
  . The average recorded temperature in June is about 75 degrees F, 4 degrees higher than the average temp in December.
    This represents a -5% change in average temperature from June to December.

  . The frequency of temperatures recorded in June tends to have a much more normal, tight bell curve distribution, with a smaller standard measure of June temps vs December temps

  . The December temperatures seem to be more variable than those in June given its larger range in recorded temperatures (comparing the max vs min temp of each month).However, when looking at the plotted distribution of Dec Temps, we can see that the median temperature in Dec is more inline with the average, and there are not many outliers skuing the average temperature higher or lower than the actual recorded frequency.

## Summary

To summarize, even though temperatures recorded in December seem to vary more than those of June, December would still provide appropriate weather conditions for both surfing and demand in ice cream. The average temperatures in June and December only differ by 4 degrees, and looking at the December histogram, I feel more confident in this decision--December's median temperature, with the highest frequency recorded across a span of years, is about 72 degrees, at least double the frequency of the next highest recorded temperatures, 75 and 67 respectively. 

However, before making a final deicision though, some additional queries can be performed to get more color on weather conditions in these two months.

The summary statistics of temperatures recorded by station for each month can be looked into. This can help determine geopgraphically where in Oahu to build the prospective shop. By comparing the variances in temperatures and the frequencies recorded, the optimal location can be narrowed down. 

Secondly, other important variables that are correlated with optimal beach and surfing weather can be reviewed. Such varibles include precipitation, wave swells and wind condition. It is important to identify these conditions and see how they correlate to foot traffic to the beach (depending on the time of year).
